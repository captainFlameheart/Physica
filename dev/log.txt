TODO: Investigate and implement correct handling of OpenGL data types and C++ data types 
(e.g. GLfloat vs float, endianness, etc.)

TODO: Implement a way to convert a fixed-point angle in the range [-M, M[ to a floating-point angle 
in the range [-PI, PI[ so that we can get cos and sin values with equal precision regardless of 
angle scale.

Part of the model: When a fixed-point value (such as x-coordinate or angle) goes out of bounds 
it will wrap around. We embrace this as a FEATURE, NOT a BUG, since its a feature of ints. 
Late game players that know of this can use this to their advantage to teleport themselves/other 
objects from one side of the map to the opposite side of the map.

TODO: Enforce static constant compiler evaluations.

TODO: Make sure to use the "restrict" memory qualifier for shader storage 
blocks.

TODO: Check if "Draw*Indirect commands" can be used to reduce transactions between CPU and GPU.

TODO: Add logic so that the current number of rigid bodies does not exceed the maximum allowed number 
of rigid bodies.
